Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

- `==` : Equal to
```python
a == b:
```
- `!=` : Not Equal to

```python
a != b:
```
- `<` : Less than

```python
a < b:
```
- `<=` : Less than or Equal to

```python
a <= b:
```
`<` : Greater than

```python
a > b:
```
- >= : Greater than or Equal to

```python
a >= b:
```

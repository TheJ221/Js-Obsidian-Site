##### Sartre's Approach

- **Transcendence**: The capacity to go beyond one's current situation in life, rooted in human consciousness.
- **Intentionality**: The fundamental property of consciousness, motivating humans to act and define their existence.

##### Key Concepts in Sartre's Philosophy

- **Being-for-itself**: Refers to self-conscious humans who are incomplete on their own and seek meaning through discovery and interaction with others.
- **Being-in-itself**: Pertains to objects, events, or roles that are definite but not conscious. Humans seek these to complete their own being.
- **Acting in Bad Faith**: The situation where individuals allow others to make decisions for them, distorting their intentionality and true being.

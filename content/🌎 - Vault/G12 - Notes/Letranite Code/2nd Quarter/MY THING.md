Certainly! Let's simplify these explanations:

1. **Church as the Mystical Body of Christ**
   - The Church is like Christ's body, with everyone in the Church working together like different parts of a body. It shows how important each person is in the Church.

2. **Fullness of Salvation through the Church**
   - The Church helps people achieve salvation, which is part of God's plan. It's like a guide that helps people follow Jesus' teachings and find spiritual fulfillment.

3. **Understanding Justice**
   - Justice means treating people fairly and doing what's right. In the Church, it's about being fair in our actions, helping others, and making sure everyone is treated well.

4. **The Church and Social Justice**
   - The Church encourages everyone to help make society fairer and better, especially for those who are less fortunate. It teaches that everyone deserves respect and a chance to live a good life.

5. **The Ten Principles of the Social Teachings of the Church**

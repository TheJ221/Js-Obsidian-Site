#### World of Ideas (World of Forms)

- **Abstract Realm**: Represents the ultimate reality, transcending the physical world.
- **Eternal and Unchangeable**: Unlike the physical world, the forms in this realm are perfect, unchanging, and eternal.
- **True Knowledge**: Knowledge of the forms is considered true knowledge, as it is about unchangeable truths.
- **Examples of Forms**: Include abstract concepts like Beauty, Justice, Equality.
- **Philosophers' Role**: According to Plato, philosophers, through reason and intellect, can access this higher realm of forms and bring knowledge to the physical world.

#### World of Senses

- **Physical Realm**: The world we experience through our senses.
- **Imperfect and Changing**: Everything in this world is an imperfect, changeable copy of the perfect forms in the World of Ideas.
- **Illusionary Knowledge**: Knowledge obtained through the senses is not considered true knowledge by Plato, as it is about things that are constantly changing.
- **Experience and Observation**: This world is known through sensory experience and observation, but such knowledge is always incomplete or imperfect compared to the understanding of the forms.

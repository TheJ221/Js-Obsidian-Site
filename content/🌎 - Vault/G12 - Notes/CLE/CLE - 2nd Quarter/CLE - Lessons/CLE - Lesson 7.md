### Fullness of Salvation through the Church

---

#### Objectives

- Understand the concept of Salvation through the Church.
- Explain the Church's role as the instrument of Salvation for mankind.
- Promote positivity through justice, peace, and charity, especially in social media.

#### Key Concepts

##### Salvation and the Church

- **Salvation Beyond Rescue**: Salvation is not just rescue but the fulfillment of God's promise through Jesus Christ's Paschal Mysteries.
- **Divine Plan of Salvation**: Man’s need for salvation has always been part of God's divine plan, not a rescue mission due to human imperfection and sin.

##### Role of the Church

- **Church as the Mystical Body of Christ**: The Church complements Jesus Christ's role in Salvation, being an integral part of the divine plan.
- **Catholic Church's Unique Position**: It retains the fullness of the four marks of the Church: One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic, deemed necessary for salvation.

##### Sacramental Nature of the Church

- **Church as a Sacrament**: A visible sign of God’s invisible grace, acting as the sacrament of salvation, connecting God and humans.
- **Inclusivity of Salvation**: Salvation is not exclusive to Catholics but available to all, including non-Christians, through God's grace.

##### Worship and Community

- **Collective Worship**: Emphasizes communal worship, like the Mass, where individuals join together in prayer.
- **Individual Devotions**: Personal worship should complement communal worship, reflecting a community of individuals united in faith.

#### Reflections

- Consider the balance between individual faith and the communal aspect of the Church in achieving salvation.
- Reflect on the inclusive nature of God's plan for salvation and how it challenges personal beliefs about salvation and the Church.
